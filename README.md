# Piano practice program using a midi keyboard


## Scope?

### With the scope of a program like this naturally being a working piano with a quiz system, the bare minimum is quite accesible. Extra questions beyond "Press this key" will be fun to make.
### And the midi loader, which will be able to load midi sequences for you to play along to will be a nice challange if we get to it in the end. 


## Resources?

### In terms of hardware, we already have a midi keyboard. I own it, Martijn sadly does not. However, with the format we'll be developing with, he can simply have the inputs temporarily be set to his own typing keyboard, and then I can change it to the midi keyboard later on. 
### For software, Unity will so far be enough. It's new input system alows for the midi to input actions. It's just the question of packages and/or other external software. Which I doubt we'll need much of. 


## What will be hard?

### The hardest part of all of this will most likely be application. Building it all up will most likely not cause to many problems, but eventually testing it, making built versions, etc, will definitly bring some problems. I'll be happy to solve them though.
