# **Piano practice program using a midi keyboard**



## **First off, why and what?**

### After a thorough look through out options in terms of an interesting special input/output. We have decided on a midi keyboard as input. It would cut on costs for new hardware, as Mikey already owns one for testing. We had some other options in mind before this however. 

* Using an eyetracker
* Hand tracking
* Donkey Kong Bongos

### These options eventually fell through, whether it was because of cost, unoriginality or a lack of documentation on it's use. Mikey shared the idea with a couple of people in his friend circle, and in class. Eventually coming to the conclusion with Martijn to make something with the Midi Keyboard, with the actual product being a keyboard practice program. A good start to more representation for the input at hand. This process was completed within a week. Development started almost immediately after. 
### With the subject of resources at hand, we needed software, which would include a programming language, and then resources to actually use the input. All of these have been met. 

* Unity (Engine)
* C# (Primary Programming Language)
* Visual Studio (IDE)
* Keijiro Takahashiâ€™s Minis Unity Package (the resource we would use to make the input work)

### Mikey found Keijiro's package during the resource research phase. The package would allow for Unity's new input system to also read the Midi inputs. This means the inputs will be streamlined as just inputs. No external method of information conversion or data needed, as it's all in Unity. 



## **Getting a feel for the idea**

### As previously mentioned, We will be making a keyboard practice program in Unity. This would require some designing so they eventually got a ground plan going. 

* Backend
 * Quiz system
 * Key press with sound
 * Free Play

* Eventual Frontend
 * Screen with input display
 * Menu for navigation

### So far, we have the design doc made. You can find this under the folder "Extra Material" here above. 
### No problems. Picking input and software was swift, and we're ready to make the product. 



## **Development and product**

### We have succesfully made the eventual product. Using our plan, we have effectively made the systems, visuals and feel for the program. The planning included:

* Get the Midi input working 
* Get the Midi input configured 
* Getting the quiz system working
* Getting a sound to play on Input 
* Getting a Ui canvas to display required field
* Making a screen model to display the required field
* Making a Menu
* Making a free play mode
* Eventual QOL controls
* Building the project as a runnable executable. 

### This plan went smoothly, without any major hastle. Only thing that was consumed was time developing it. 
### Every deadline we set for a segment was hit without issue. And we are proud of the product we have made. You can find the product in a zip file under "Releases".


## **User Testing**

### The first wave of user tests have been completed. With our target audience being people with next to no musical knowledge in terms of piano, we decided on 3 candidates. 

* Martijn's Mother
* Martijn's Brother
* Mikey's best friend

### This went well. We got the groundworks down, and agreed on some methods and questions. 

* Documentation
 * Videos will be recorded with both the screen and a webcam on. 
 * All videos will be put into a playlist and uploaded to YouTube.
 * Notes will be documented under such videos present here on the readme. 

* Planned questions
 * What did you think of the gameplay?
 * How did it feel to play?
 * What did you think of the visuals?
 * As someone who doesn't do music, did you learn from this experience?
 * Do you have anything you would add or take away?


### Here are the videos with the interviews:

 * "What did you think of the gameplay?"                                       : "I thought it was nice. I thought the Quiz would be better if it was more expanded, but the freeplay mode is quite fun."
 * "How did it feel to play?"                                                  : "It felt great. Nothing I'd add or remove in terms of feel."
 * "What did you think of the visuals?"                                        : "I like the artstyle. It's smooth and fits the style of gameplay."
 * "As someone who doesn't do music, did you learn from this experience?"      : "I actually did get the hang of it. Which I believe means it's working."
 * "Do you have anything you would add or take away?"                          : "I would add more modes. A training mode, Endless mode, and maybe a campaign of some sorts."
